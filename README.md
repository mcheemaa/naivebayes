# Naive Bayes Algorithm

In this naivebayes.py  trains a Naive Bayes classifier from a training file and makes predictions on an input file which contains independent data samples with the same set of features. For example, runs using the provided sample files (sampletraining.arff and sampleinput.arff) as below: $python3 naivebayes.py sampletraining.arff sampleinput.arff predictions.txt.
